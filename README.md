Getting Started
------
The goal is to pass a line through all green cells while avoiding all red cells.
Click on any cell to activate a **branch**.  A branched line will split into two.
When two lines pass through the same cell, they will **merge**.  Merged lines will nullify each other's path.
Strokes are counted per activated cell.  Lower strokes are better like golf.  Hence the terms strokes and par.
